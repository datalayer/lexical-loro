# CLI Updates for Step 5 Server

## Overview
The CLI has been updated to reflect the Step 5 pure WebSocket relay server architecture and cleaned up old server files.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated CLI Documentation**

**Before:**
```python
"""
Command line interface for the Lexical Loro server
"""

def main(port: int, host: str, log_level: str):
    """
    Start the Lexical Loro WebSocket server for real-time collaboration.
    
    This server handles Loro CRDT operations for collaborative text editing
    with Lexical editor clients.
    """
```

**After:**
```python
"""
Command line interface for the Lexical Loro server
Step 5: CLI for pure WebSocket relay server
"""

def main(port: int, host: str, log_level: str):
    """
    Start the Lexical Loro WebSocket relay server for real-time collaboration.
    
    Step 5: This server is now a pure WebSocket relay that delegates all 
    document and ephemeral operations to LexicalModel. The server only handles:
    - Client connections and WebSocket communication
    - Message routing to LexicalModel methods  
    - Broadcasting responses from LexicalModel events
    
    All Loro CRDT operations and ephemeral data management are handled by LexicalModel.
    """
```

### 2. **Updated CLI Output Messages**

**Before:**
```python
click.echo(f"ðŸš€ Starting Lexical Loro server on {host}:{port}")
click.echo(f"ðŸ“‹ Log level: {log_level}")
click.echo("Press Ctrl+C to stop the server")
```

**After:**
```python
click.echo(f"ðŸš€ Starting Lexical Loro relay server on {host}:{port}")
click.echo(f"ðŸ“‹ Log level: {log_level}")
click.echo("ðŸ“¡ Step 5: Pure WebSocket relay - all operations delegated to LexicalModel")
click.echo("Press Ctrl+C to stop the server")
```

### 3. **Cleaned Up Old Server Files**

**Removed:**
- `lexical_loro/server_simplified.py` (Step 4 version)
- `lexical_loro/server_step5.py` (Step 5 development version)

**Kept:**
- `lexical_loro/server.py` (Current Step 5 production version)

## CLI Usage Examples

### Default Settings
```bash
python -m lexical_loro.cli
# Output: ðŸš€ Starting Lexical Loro relay server on localhost:8081
#         ðŸ“‹ Log level: INFO
#         ðŸ“¡ Step 5: Pure WebSocket relay - all operations delegated to LexicalModel
```

### Custom Host and Port
```bash
python -m lexical_loro.cli --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8082
# Starts relay server on 0.0.0.0:8082
```

### Help Output
```bash
python -m lexical_loro.cli --help
# Shows updated documentation explaining Step 5 architecture
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Clear Communication**
- CLI output clearly indicates this is a Step 5 relay server
- Help text explains the delegation architecture
- Users understand the server's role vs LexicalModel's role

### 2. **Clean Codebase**
- Removed old server file versions
- Single source of truth for server implementation
- No confusion about which server is being used

### 3. **Accurate Documentation**
- CLI documentation matches the actual Step 5 architecture
- Clear explanation of server responsibilities
- Accurate description of delegation pattern

## Testing Results

âœ… **CLI help works**: Updated documentation displayed correctly  
âœ… **Server starts**: Step 5 relay server starts successfully  
âœ… **No syntax errors**: Clean code with no issues  
âœ… **Old files removed**: Cleaned up development artifacts  
âœ… **Messaging clear**: Users understand Step 5 architecture  

## CLI Migration Complete

The CLI has been successfully updated to:
- Use the Step 5 pure WebSocket relay server
- Provide accurate documentation about server architecture  
- Remove old server file versions
- Clearly communicate the delegation model to users

The CLI now accurately represents the Step 5 implementation where the server is a pure relay that delegates all operations to LexicalModel.
