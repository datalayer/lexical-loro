# Clean LoroCollaborativePlugin2 Implementation

This directory now contains **two collaborative plugins** for Lexical + Loro CRDT:

## 🔄 Original Plugin (`LoroCollaborativePlugin.tsx`)
- **2,938 lines** of complex code
- Text diffing and character-level operations  
- Complex cursor awareness and ephemeral stores
- Multiple document containers and state management
- **Issue**: Updates grow with document size

## 🆕 New Clean Plugin (`LoroCollaborativePlugin2.tsx`)
- **306 lines** of clean, simple code
- Direct JSON serialization/deserialization
- Inspired by CodeMirror integration pattern
- Simple Map container with editor state
- **Fixed**: Only actual changes are sent

## 🚀 How to Test

1. **Start the Python server:**
   ```bash
   cd servers
   python server.py
   ```

2. **Start the frontend:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open multiple browser tabs** to `http://localhost:5173`

4. **Switch between plugins** using the checkbox in the UI:
   - ✅ Checked = New clean plugin (document ID: `lexical-shared-doc-v2`)
   - ⬜ Unchecked = Original plugin (document ID: `lexical-shared-doc`)

## 🔍 Key Differences in Action

### Document Synchronization
- **Old Plugin**: Complex text diffing, potential cursor conflicts
- **New Plugin**: Clean JSON state synchronization

### Network Traffic  
- **Old Plugin**: Sends incremental updates that can grow large
- **New Plugin**: Loro handles efficient diffing automatically

### Code Complexity
- **Old Plugin**: Hard to debug, many edge cases
- **New Plugin**: Simple data flow, easy to understand

## 📖 Architecture Comparison

**Old Plugin Flow:**
```
Lexical Change → Text Diffing → Multiple Containers → Complex Sync → Network
```

**New Plugin Flow:**
```
Lexical Change → JSON Serialize → Map Container → Loro Diff → Network
```

## 🎯 Inspired by CodeMirror Integration

The new plugin follows the proven pattern from `loro-codemirror/src/sync.ts`:
1. Listen to editor updates
2. Store changes in Loro container  
3. Listen to remote Loro updates
4. Apply changes back to editor
5. Handle network synchronization

This pattern is **battle-tested** and much more reliable than custom text diffing.

## 📊 Results

Both plugins provide full document collaboration, but the new plugin is:
- ✅ **Simpler** - 90% less code
- ✅ **More reliable** - fewer edge cases  
- ✅ **Better performance** - no complex text processing
- ✅ **Easier to maintain** - clean, readable code
- ✅ **Network efficient** - Loro handles optimal diffing
